### Decorations

Good atmosphere and a friendly experience is extremely important, so if your budget is big enough, don't think twice about [printing some posters](../resources/README.md), buying fresh flowers or bringing nice tablecloths. These small little things can go a long way toward making a better experience for everyone. We all like nice things, right?

Also, decorations for the booth are up to you and are super-important to drive traffic to your booth! Here are some options/suggestions based on past DG:

* Printed tablecloths
* LED lightstrips (that you can control with a Raspberry Pi!)
* [Brown packing paper](http://www.amazon.co.uk/750mm-Heavy-Brown-Kraft-Wrapping/dp/B00684AYTY/) + [white/black/gold markers](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00BSR8OFC) and someone with nice handwriting
* [Gold balloons](http://www.ebay.com/itm/16-40-Gold-Silver-Foil-Letter-Number-Balloons-Birthday-Wedding-Party-Decoration-/141467803149?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&var=440617724363&hash=item20f0235e0d)
* Flowers in pots, or if you can't get pots, use old cans + gold spray paint!
* Workshop poster with the sponsor logos (you can just move the posters that you printed for the workshop and hang them on the walls or on boards).

### Swag

* When you order swag for the workshop, choose a few key cheap items (like pens, buttons, or stickers) and order double/triple/etc so that you have enough to give away at the conference.
* More expensive items such as tote bags or shirts can be sold at the booth for donations. Make sure to get a tip jar for cash, and also some form of online payment such as bigcartel.com or tictail.com, for people who want to pay with their credit cards.
* Print little cards/flyers with links to the organizer manual, coaching manual, email to hello@djangogirls.org, to give out to people who want to organize or coach future workshops.
* If you're planning to sell swag, you can use [mini-blackboard signs](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Hot-Sales-Mini-Small-Wood-Blackboard-Wedding-Buffet-Blackboards-Chalkboards-/351214608057?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item51c6059eb9) to highlight the price.
* Make sure you have a plan for what to do with cash income from swag. If the conference organizers can help store it for you or deposit it in the conference account and then transfer it to the DG account, it'll reduce stress of wandering around with wads of money!
* Try to think of a useful way to utilize the funds from swag sales. For example, if you're planning a follow-up workshop, you can keep the funds for that, or you can help out another workshop that's running into sponsorship trouble.
